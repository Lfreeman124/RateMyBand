We then had their three piece acoustic line up (signer, cajon and acoustic guitar) who learned and played us our first dance followed by a full set that was expertly delivered. As musical people ourselves, it’s obvious they are individually talented with a high level and well practiced professional performance together.

          "The Monochromes played at our wedding recently and they were excellent. We chose them because they had a good Facebook page with lots of videos of them playing at local venues. You could see their energy and ability to fill a dance floor! Paul got in touch about a month before the being day to discuss everything, incorporating our requests and advising on what would work best on the day. On the day itself, they were fantastic. We had 3 sets of 45 minutes which kept the party going. Our only regret was that our dance floor was too small - All our guests packed on to the dance floor to enjoy the music! It has now been a week since our big day and we are still receiving compliments from friends and family regarding the band - many of whom stayed later than they were expecting and delayed their taxis so they could enjoy the music. I'd definitely recommend the Monochromes!",
